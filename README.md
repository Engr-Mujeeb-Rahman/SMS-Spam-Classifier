🎯 Project Workflow
Text Input: User enters an SMS message.
Preprocessing: Text is cleaned, tokenized, and stemmed.
Vectorization: Preprocessed text is transformed using a trained TF-IDF vectorizer.
Prediction: The trained machine learning model predicts if the SMS is spam or not.
Result Display: A friendly message shows the classification result.
